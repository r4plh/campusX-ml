# IN THE START ONLY - GET AWARE OF TUTORIAL'S HELL 
Before diving into any tech , one should definately know about tutorial's hell , go search it , read something about it and see some vidoes on YT about tutorial's hell.

[STOP Watching Coding Tutorials Right Now! My LEARNING FRAMEWORK](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L5kVBays24&t=506s)

To begin learning machine learning, having a basic understanding of Python is essential. You don’t need to be highly proficient—just familiar enough to understand and write basic code. Python is simply a tool, one of several, and it’s a foundational prerequisite, not the end goal. Keep in mind, the aim is to master machine learning concepts, not the tools themselves.

Once we dive into ML algorithms and their underlying math, tools like Python, math libraries, and data handling packages will support our learning. But remember: the focus should always be on learning ML concepts, not on becoming an expert in any specific tool. As we progress, we’ll encounter libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn. These will be crucial, but the goal is to use them effectively, not to perfect them, as that would take a significant amount of time to perfect one. You can always come back and visit the documentation if there's a need.  

# Move Quick
As it's not required to get in extensive depth of understaning the tools , one should cover them fast to get on the main game that is Machine Leanring quickly While there’s no need to go deeply into Python, math, or libraries like NumPy and Pandas, make sure you give them enough time to understand properly. Moving quickly doesn’t mean rushing—dedicate your time wisely to each topic, ensuring you genuinely grasp the essentials.

To sum up, we’re here to learn machine learning. We only need enough proficiency with tools to keep moving forward in understanding ML concepts without getting stuck on technical details.
A basic elementary maths is also a pre-requisite covering topics like - Matrices , basic calculus and aptitude. Covering these tools/skills at baisc level itslef is also valuable enough to contribute as data analyst kind of role , after this covering ML concepts and implementing them in problem statements paves your way towards role of ML enginner which is very very valuable in recent times. (All jargons of Deep learning , Gen AI engineer etc start from here).

# Preparing for Machine Learning: Sharpening the Axe Before Cutting the Tree

Before diving into machine learning itself, we’re first "sharpening the axe" to ensure a smoother journey ahead. Jumping straight into ML without covering the basics can lead to setbacks and frustration, so it’s wise to build a solid foundation first. While the initial steps may feel slow or even dull, stick with it—the concepts and logic will soon start to make sense, and that’s when the excitement begins. Embrace the process, stay patient, and soon enough, everything will fall into place. 

## Pre-requisite 
1. Python: From Scratch/Fundamental till Machine Learning Essentials

[Session 1 - Python Fundamentals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1z5-O7-5AXk&list=PLKnIA16_RmvbAlyx4_rdtR66B7EHX5k3z&index=1)

[Programming Problems on Strings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ltjqU5iytY&list=PLKnIA16_RmvbAlyx4_rdtR66B7EHX5k3z&index=4)

[Session 4 - Lists in Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmbU3WBaoR0&list=PLKnIA16_RmvbAlyx4_rdtR66B7EHX5k3z&index=9)

[Session 5 - Tuples + Sets + Dictionary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcQjp11mn1A&list=PLKnIA16_RmvbAlyx4_rdtR66B7EHX5k3z&index=10)

[Session 6 - Functions in Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOInK25PoFo&list=PLKnIA16_RmvbAlyx4_rdtR66B7EHX5k3z&index=11)

Apart from just coding along , solve few questions to get a grip and avoid tutorial's hell , solve few questions on python , basic to medium level would suffice , if one already knows a language other than python , this would wrap up in a day or two , otheriwse a bit more time would be taken by one who's new to the tech world - maybe 2-3 more days. One can return later after a while maybe after completing some ML algorithm to master python later as per one's wish , our main aim is to become a proficient ML engineer , not a proficient python programmer as of now and as far as this roadmap is concerned , Understaing OOPS (Object Oriented Programming is not required as of now , it is important , but things works if we skip OOPS for now , after studying ML algo we may return and master OOPS later , depends on one's wish , because we will use class and objects and librarires (numpy , pandas etc) and implementing them as beginner , at advance level people use OOPS and make their own class and objects and use them , although it is a good thing , but this is a begnnier friendly roadmap).

2. Numpy: From Scratch

[Session 13 - Numpy Fundamentals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF6DCrNTzug&list=PLKnIA16_RmvbAlyx4_rdtR66B7EHX5k3z&index=41)

[Session 14 - Advanced Numpy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40xGMygHMDU&list=PLKnIA16_RmvbAlyx4_rdtR66B7EHX5k3z&index=43)

[Numpy Documentation](https://numpy.org/)

4. Pandas: Basics

The Data Science Mentorship Program (DSMP) 2022-23 playlist features over 10 hours of content on the Pandas library, covering it in extensive detail. Pandas is one of the most important tools for data manipulation and is used in nearly all machine learning projects. However, spending over 10 hours on this topic may be excessive for now; we only need a basic understanding or more than basic of its implementation to get started with machine learning.

Additionally, it’s important to note that SQL and the Pandas library serve similar purposes. SQL is a highly sought-after skill in the industry, and while the logic in both Pandas and SQL is comparable, the syntax differs. Thus, the effort invested in mastering Pandas could also translate well into SQL proficiency , one can come back later and master SQL and also practice it , but excelling either of the two in depth (Pandas or SQL) is not our concern as of now.

At this stage, our primary focus should be on mastering the fundamentals of Pandas to ease our entry into machine learning. A useful resource for this is a playlist from Campus X that was created previously. These videos are designed for Jupyter Notebook; however, you don’t need to install Jupyter, as you can easily work in Google Colab instead and continue working on Google Collab. This playlist doesn’t delve too deeply into the subject but effectively covers the basics we are currently interested in.

The remaining two tools we'll cover are for data visualization: Matplotlib and Seaborn. Based on my personal experience, it’s not necessary to memorize all the code associated with these libraries. Instead, it’s more important to grasp the underlying concepts and know where to find information when you need to create specific plots.

Developing a habit of referring to the documentation when you feel stuck, or utilizing resources like Google or ChatGPT, will be valuable in helping you create the visualizations you need. Get familiar with these libraries without investing too much time learning every detail. Save your energy for the more critical aspects of our journey—machine learning is just around the corner!

5. Matplotlib: Basic plotting using Matplotlib

[Session 23 - Plotting using Matplotlib](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaKn_cKFlSY&list=PLKnIA16_RmvbAlyx4_rdtR66B7EHX5k3z&index=73)

[Matplotlib Documentation](https://matplotlib.org/)

6. Seaborn : Plotting using Seaborn

[Session 25 - Plotting using Seaborn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWVLRhnuGqI&list=PLKnIA16_RmvbAlyx4_rdtR66B7EHX5k3z&index=78)

[Seaborn Documentation](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)

The next two videos on data gathering and data assessment are optional. If these topics seem uninteresting at the moment, feel free to skip them; you can always refer back if needed in the future. However, if the titles catch your interest, I recommend watching these two videos quickly. There's no need to code along—just focus on understanding the concepts being discussed, as they could prove useful later on.

[Session 27 - Data Gathering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dA6ZksRR6aw&list=PLKnIA16_RmvbAlyx4_rdtR66B7EHX5k3z&index=82)

[Session 28 - Data Assessing and Cleaning ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HnN8GBINnc&list=PLKnIA16_RmvbAlyx4_rdtR66B7EHX5k3z&index=84)

I have not explicitly mentioned any roadmap to maths required , it's basic linear algebra , basic calculus and dervivates , concept of maxima and minima and matrices. - TO start ML.

Finally! We have reached the point where we can begin our journey into machine learning! Most of the videos on ML algorithms after the "Introduction to ML" follow a consistent pattern: first, they explain the mathematical concepts related to the algorithm, then demonstrate how to implement it using Scikit-learn. As you engage with this content, you will gain a clearer understanding of what’s happening—so just dive in!

Scikit-learn is an additional tool, a dedicated machine learning library in Python. You don’t need to learn Scikit-learn separately; it’s designed to be understood in conjunction with the machine learning algorithms you’ll be studying. We will start exploring Scikit-learn when we dive into our first ML algorithm, Linear Regression. Let’s get started!

[Introduction to Machine Learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ctqJCHMAmc&list=PLKnIA16_RmvbAlyx4_rdtR66B7EHX5k3z&index=144)

This is a long 3.5 hour video (this is essential to understand and start with flow) , after this one will start with the classical ML theory that is taught in one of the most famous course Andrew NG course in (English+Hindi).

From this point forward, we need to delve into the concepts in great depth. Don’t hesitate to use ChatGPT or Claude 3.5 to ask any questions you have, no matter how foolish or newbie they may seem. Remember, there’s no such thing as a foolish question. I have frequently used them to clarify my own doubts in machine learning, and they almost all times deliver highly accurate answers regarding ML algorithms.

Explore these concepts as deeply as you can with the help of Google, ChatGPT, and other search resources. I’ve had extensive conversations with ChatGPT to address even my most basic questions, and it has always guided me to a clearer understanding. Engage actively, and let’s ensure you grasp every aspect of the material. Doing this activity will make one's leanring fun. Understand concepts like you're understaning the concepts related to physics using maths as a tool (This is my personal analogy to ML). No need to install jupyter notebook , continue working in google collab only , in the videos maybe jupyter notebook is used , but I think Collab's interface is much better.

Here's start of classical ML theory - leanring on ML algorithms - maths + code
